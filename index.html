                            In this exercise, the idea is to write a paragraph that would be a random passage from a story. An <em>effective</em> paragraph is one that has unity (it isn’t a hodgepodge of things), focus (everything in the paragraph stacks up to the whatever-it-is the paragraph is about), and <u>coherence</u> (the content follows smoothly). For this exercise, the paragraph should be quick to read--say, not be more than 100 words long.</p>

The flaking paint on the buildings had chalked to a pastel pink on walls covered with graffiti. Many of the windows had been smashed out. Where the sign had been, atop rusting steel posts, only the metal outline of a seashell remained of.Lines of weeds criss-crossed the cracked parking lot of the Seashell Motor Courts.
